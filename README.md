REITs are required by law to distribute more than 90% of their earnings in the form of dividends. This can make them incredibly profitable for investors and provide a steady stream of cash flow in the form of regular, high dividends.

Types of REIT Stocks – #1: Office
Office REITs own, manage or develop office real estate. The properties held by office REITs range from skyscrapers to office parks with many types of properties in between. Office REITs may choose to focus on specific markets, such as urban business hubs or suburban areas. Another common strategy is for office REITs to focus on specific groups of tenants, such as tech firms or government agencies.

Large office REITs include Alexandria Real Estate Properties, Inc (NYSE: ARE), Boston Properties, Inc. (NYSE: BXP) and SL Green Realty Corporation (NYSE: SLG)

Types of REIT Stocks – #2: Industrial 
Industrial REITs own and manage properties that are used for manufacturing, production, storage and distribution of goods. Such properties include factories, distribution centers, warehouses and e-commerce fulfillment centers. Generally, these industrial properties are located outside of cities because their operations require a lot of space.
